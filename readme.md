## Overview
Reditto is a simple web app that talks to Reddit API and displays posts for `Hot`and `New` categories by utilizing the tech stack listed above. It was created as a homework assignment from a job interview but could easily be leveraged as boilerplate by those who are looking for working configuration for the particular stack above. It can be helpful for projects moving from traditional `LAMP` stack to more modern stack.
